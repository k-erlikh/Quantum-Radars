# Quantum Radars

## Overview
A performance-based analysis of a QNX RTOS simulation of Quantum Two-Mode Squeezing Radar systems using emulated Josephson parametric amplifiers. 

## Purpose
<p> Modern radar technology faces significant challenges in signal detection, particularly with environmental clutter and signal attenuation, which limit sensitivity and target identification. These barriers have increased the demand for research in complex signal processing, driving up the production cost and system complexities of classical radars. Quantum radar proposes a promising alternative, utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics to surpass classical detection limits in high-noise environments. Quantum illuminance is a paradigm that employs an entangled photon signal to perform matched filtering, enabling superior target distinction in an unfavourable environment. </p>

<p> Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPA) are central to the success of quantum radars, serving two major roles: signal generation and low-noise reception. JPAs are used to create a two-mode squeezed vacuum entangled signal, which provides a phase-sensitive amplification mechanism necessary for detecting low-reflectivity objects, such as stealth aircraft. JPA creates a pair of entangled photon signals with a specific phase amplitude, where one signal is sent towards the target, and the other remains at the source, where it can be measured as a reference. If a target exists, the JPA can amplify the signal of the original entangled signal and perform match filtering to bypass noise. The primary research question addressed in this project is to determine whether quantum radars outperform their classical counterparts in terms of signal detection in high-noise environments. </p>
